# Drug-Classification-Using-Regression-Tree
In this project we have tried to classify the type of 
drug based on the given features.This is a small scale project but 
can be used as a reference for implementation in large scale drug 
classifications. In this we have used the dataset from an open 
source website Kaggle. The dataset contained symptoms and 
status of human health and the specific drug which was used on 
the condition of a patient. The patient can enter the values of the 
given features or symptoms and then the model will run and get 
the best drug suited for the given symptoms of the patient. We 
first visualized the dataset using many plots and gathered the 
required data. We pre-processed the data to make it suitable for 
classification, and then we applied many machine learning 
algorithms on the dataset to check which one would give us the 
best score.
